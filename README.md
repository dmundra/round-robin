# round-robin

Creating tournament generator to simulate rounds.

# Problem

How to get all OCL matches raw scoresheet data on at least one device at the end of the tournament.

# Notes and requirements

* Each team has a device with the cricket scoring app and bluetooth only for transfer. Emailing the raw data does not work.
* Each team will play at most every other team.
* An easy solution is a member from each team with the device meets at a common location in the end and does the transfer but that is a lazy solution. How can we use the fact that "Each team will play at most every other team."
